We are a team of researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduate researchers) led by Dr. Saiprasad (Sai) Ravishankar in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, and working on problems in computational imaging, image reconstruction, machine learning, signal processing, and optimization. The SLIM group focuses particularly on smart imaging systems, with the development of models, machine learning methods, and theory forming a bedrock of some of the group's efforts.
